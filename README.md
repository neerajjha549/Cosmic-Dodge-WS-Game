## üéÆ How to Play

### Hosting a Game

The "host" is the person who will run the Python server on their machine.

1.  **Find Your LAN IP Address:** You'll need this so other players can connect to you.
    
    -   **On Windows:** Open Command Prompt, type `ipconfig`, and look for the "IPv4 Address".
        
    -   **On macOS/Linux:** Open the Terminal, type `ifconfig | grep "inet "`, and find the local IP address (it usually starts with `192.168.` or `10.0.`).
        
2.  **Start the Server:** Navigate to the directory containing the game files in your terminal and run the server:
    
    ```
    python3 server.py
    
    ```
    
    You should see the message: `Server started on ws://0.0.0.0:8765`. The server is now running and waiting for players.
    

### Joining a Game

1.  **Open the Game:** The client cannot just open index.html directly in the browser (file:///...) because browsers have security restrictions. You need to serve it via a simple local web server.

Python has a built-in one that is perfect for this. In a new terminal window (leave the game server running), navigate to your project directory and run:
    ```
    python3 -m http.server
    ```

Now, open your web browser and go to: `http://localhost:8000`
    
2.  **Enter Details and Join:** You will see a login screen.
    
    -   In the **"Host IP Address"** field, enter the LAN IP address of the person hosting the game.
        
    -   Enter your name.
        
    -   Click **"Join Game"**.
        
3.  **Play!** Once joined, use your mouse to move your spaceship around the screen and dodge the falling asteroids. Good luck!
